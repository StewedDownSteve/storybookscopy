# My Story (Fullstack)
A full-stack web app, copy of Storybooks format and function. Allows the user to log in using Google and post and share their own stories.

# How It's Made:
 Node.js/Express/MongoDB/ Handlebars with Google OAuth for authentication. 

This helped tie in all my knowledge of Node, Express, and Mongo. Learning how to implement Google OAuth was much easier than originally expected. I got more familiar with Handlebars for forms and page layout. It has a simple dashboard that welcomes the user by their first name based on their Google login. The dashboard shows the stories they have written.

# Optimizations

If I were to go back I would fix a few errors due to an updated version of Mongoose. I used a two-year-old tutorial so I have to install older versions.
For fun, I would add as many authentications as I could, like Snapchat, Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, etc. I may take this same sort of layout and try to make different applications with it.
  

# Lessons Learned:
Honestly, this was a huge win for me. Tying together all my knowledge to make a full-stack app with authentication that actually can run made me feel like my back-end skills are growing. I have a lot to learn but I'm excited to make more apps like this and put my spin on them.
